      This is a robotic couch. It is remote-controlled via an xbox controller.
      It can carry three people. It's exactly what it sounds like, and is a ton
      of fun. This project was made with the Tufts Robotics Club, and was one of
      my first large-scale robotics projects. It was built using FIRST robotics
      hardware, and programmed in C++. At one point we had an actual couch on
      it, but due to storage problems it had to be thrown out.
