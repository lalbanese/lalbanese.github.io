      This robot is one of the first I've made from scratch, and was made for
      the Trinity International Robotic Firefighting Competition in the Spring
      of 2018. It's task was to listen for a tone, and when signaled would begin
      to autonomously navigate a maze and extinguish a fire. It was powered by a
      Raspberry Pi Zero and was surrounded by ultrasonic distance sensors to
      detect the walls of the maze.
